        Shadow and Griffon aren't simple weapons: they're extensions of V's fractured soul. Each represents a part of his divided identity. Griffon, sarcastic and talkative, channels electric powers from a distance; Shadow, beastly and stealthy, transforms into multiple weapons for close combat. Together they don't just fight; they also reflect his fragility and dependence. Unlike other characters, V doesn't attack directly: he needs them to survive. This makes them more than demonic summons; they are his shield, his spear, and his voice. They are fragments of Vergil's power, embodied in a form V can control. Fighting with them is fighting with his past. Therefore, every move they make isn't just offensive: it is memory, it is weight, it is redemption in the form of beasts.
