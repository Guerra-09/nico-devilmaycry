        Rebellion is more than a blade: it's Sparda's legacy. In Devil May Cry, Dante wields it from the very beginning, but its true power goes beyond the physical. It was entrusted to him by his father as an heirloom, and it acts as the key that awakens his demonic power. It's not just a weapon: it represents the conflict between his human side and his infernal lineage. Unlike other blades obtained in battle, this one connects him to his destiny from the very beginning. In DMC3, Rebellion is key to activating his Devil Trigger: Dante must run himself through with it to awaken his true form. Its power lies in the bond with its wielder's soul, not in the blade itself. That moment defines his evolution: no longer just a sarcastic hunter, but a force that can challenge Hell.
